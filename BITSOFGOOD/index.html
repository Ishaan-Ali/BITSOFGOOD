        Hi, my name is Ishaan Ali. I'm a Second year Computer science student at Georgia Tech. 
        I'm very passionate about being able to use programming and web development 
        to help the world become a better place. In my spare time, I enjoy learning new things about programming, working at my local religious center
        to introduce students to a variety of STEM and programming subjects.
        and tutoring other students who are eager to learn programming through various online/remote platforms.
